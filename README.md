# Pursuit evasion on a grid

A demo program to simulate pursuit evasion on a grid

## Simulations

At the start, players have a set of units with initial starting
locations.  The system will query for actions from all the players.
Using the chosen actions, the system will then move each unit.  Then
the loop repeats.
